\section{Abstract}
\instruction{Please write a 500â€“600 word abstract on the project idea. It should not be very technically written but should be understandable by anyone.}

\section{Problem definition}

Pakistan has an employed population (formal and informal) of 71.76 million \cite{governmentofpakistan2021PakistanLabourForce2021} with a significant portion of the workforce
employed in the manufacturing (14.9\%) and construction (14.4\%) sectors \cite{governmentofpakistan2021PakistanLabourForce2021}. 
Out of the total workforce population, 1.9 (2.7\%) million people faced a work related injury in 2020-2021. Out of these 1.9 million people who were injured,
about 40.5\% of workers had to consult a medical professional, 11.7\% had to get hospitalized and 31.6\% were forced to take took time off work becuase of their injury
\cite{governmentofpakistan2021PakistanLabourForce2021}. The labour workforce in the Industrial sector (engaged in assembly and manufacturing) is one of the most dangerous 
sectors to work in, accounting for 20\% of all workplace injuries in 2020-2021 \cite{governmentofpakistan2021PakistanLabourForce2021}.
With the monthly average income in the Manufacturing sector being 22,000 PKR \cite{governmentofpakistan2021PakistanLabourForce2021}, 
such injuries can have a significant impact on the financial stability of the workers and their families with many not being able to afford healthcare services at all. 
Employers are usually unwilling to provide insurance for their workers, and the government does not have a comprehensive social security system in place to support the injured workers.
But even the critique of employers providing insurance exisits only for the workers in the formal sector, the informal sector workers
(the majority of the labour segment) are left to fend for themselves entirely. It should also be noted that Pakistan stands as one of the countries with the 
least amount of regulation and protection when it comes to labor rights and labor unions. For a labor force of 10.63 million (that is part of the formal sector),
Pakistan has nearly 517 labour inspectors which means one inspector for more than 20,560 workers\cite{Whistlers}
contributing to the neglect of Labour rights,safety protocols and education of the workers into safe practices.



We are monitoring: Hard hat, Safety Vest, Fall Detection/Accident Detection, Hazardous Zones Entry


In the context of the company we are working with, Dawlence assures us that all their workers are given safety equipment. Our project aims to make sure that the workers are using this equipment when on the factory floor. 


\section{Social relevance}


By detecting unsafe behaviors and conditions in real-time, this project aims to reduce workplace injuries in industrial enviroments, addressing a critical societal issue related to the safety and health of workers. 
Fewer workplace accidents also lead to reduced healthcare costs and less downtime due to injuries, lowering the economic burden on both companies and workers (who already have limited funds to spend on healthcare).

Given the small number of labour inspectors for the millions of workers in Pakistan, automating safety monitoring safety monitoring ensures better compliance with safety regulations,
reducing the need for a large fleet of human inspectors which suits the current socio-economic conditions of Pakistan's government. 
The proposed system will also provide insights and analytics, which could help Dawlence identify trends and continuously improve workplace safety. This approach encourages a shift towards more proactive safety management, benefiting both employees and employers.
