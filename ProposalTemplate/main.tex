\section{Abstract}
\instruction{Please write a 500â€“600 word abstract on the project idea. It should not be very technically written but should be understandable by anyone.}

\section{Problem definition}
\instruction{Describe the problem that the project addresses.}

In the context of the company we are working with, Dawlence assures us that all their workers are given safety equipment. Our project aims to make sure that the workers are using this equipment when on the factory floor. 


\section{Social relevance}

Pakistan stands as one fo the countires with the least amount of regulation and protection when it comes to labor rights and labor unions. 
For a labor force of 10.63 million (that is part of the formal sector), Pakistan has nearly 517 labour inspectors
which means one inspector for more than 20,560 workers\cite{Whistlers} contributing to the neglect of Labour rights, 
safety protocols and education of the workers into safe practices. The labour that works in the Industrial sector in machine assembling and manufacturing is especially at risk, with 2.7 million of the employed population (61.7 million) experienceing an injury at work in 2017-18 segment \cite{nomanAssessmentOccupationalInjuries2021}. 
This is the labour segment our project directly addresses and aims to help. We hope to relieve some pressure from the Dawlence team and the goverment by automating the process of checking for compliance with safety procedures, reducing the need for human inspectors and increasing the efficiency of the process.




\section{Originality/Novelty}
\instruction{Describe the value of solving the problem. Compare and contrast with any existing solutions.}

\section{Feasibility}
\instruction{List the resources, e.g.\ datasets, compute resources, software libraries, hardware, required for the project. Mention how you expect to access and utilize them for the project.}

\section{Team dynamics}
\instruction{Justify the suitability of the team members to the project. For example, their relevant courses, projects, internships, or research.}

\section{Tech stack}
