\section{Abstract}
\instruction{Please write a 500â€“600 word abstract on the project idea. It should not be very technically written but should be understandable by anyone.}

\section{Problem definition}

Pakistan has an employed population of 71.76 million \cite{governmentofpakistan2021PakistanLabourForce2021} with a significant portion of the workforce
employed in the manufacturing (14.9\%) and construction (14.4\%) sectors \cite{governmentofpakistan2021PakistanLabourForce2021}. 
Out of the total workforce population, 1.9 million (2.7\% of Total) people faced a work related injury in 2020-2021. Of these injured people,
40.5\% of workers had to consult a medical professional, 11.7\% had to get hospitalized and 31.6\% were forced to take took time off work becuase of their injury
\cite{governmentofpakistan2021PakistanLabourForce2021}. The labour workforce in the industrial sector (engaged in assembly and manufacturing) is one of the most dangerous 
sectors to work in, accounting for 20\% of all workplace injuries in 2020-2021 \cite{governmentofpakistan2021PakistanLabourForce2021}.
With the monthly average income in the manufacturing sector being 22,000 PKR \cite{governmentofpakistan2021PakistanLabourForce2021}, 
such injuries can have a significant impact on the financial stability of the workers and their families with many not being able to afford healthcare services at all. 
Formal sector employers usually hestitate to provide insurance for their workers, and the government does not have a comprehensive social security system in place to support these injured workers.
The informal sector workers are left to fend for themselves entirely, as Informal sector jobs don't involve formal work agreements, leading to the workers
being deprived of their labour rights entirely. The data on the number of injuries or deaths that occur in the informal sector can also be inaccurate due to it's unregulated nature. 
It should also be noted that Pakistan stands as one of the countries with the least amount of regulation and ;protection when it comes to labor rights. For a labor force of 10.63 million (that is part of the formal sector),
Pakistan has nearly 517 labour inspectors which means one inspector for more than 20,560 workers\cite{Whistlers} contributing to the neglect of Labour rights, safety protocols and education of the workers into safe practices.
\\ \\
This project aims to address the issue of workplace safety in the industrial sector by developing a real-time safety monitoring system that can detect unsafe behaviors and conditions in the workplace. 
Such a system can help prevent accidents and injuries by alerting workers and supervisors when unsafe conditions are detected, allowing them to take corrective action \textbf{before} an accident occurs.
Such a system should also be able to detect if an accident has occured and alert the relevant authorities so that immediate action can be taken to help the injured worker. For the manufacturers, such a system can help 
them comply with safety regulations and reduce workplace injuries. For the workers, such a system can help them stay safe and avoid accidents, reducing the financial burden of healthcare costs
and lost wages. 


\section{Social relevance}


By detecting unsafe behaviors and conditions in real-time, this project aims to reduce workplace injuries in industrial enviroments, addressing a critical societal issue related to the safety and health of workers. 
Fewer workplace accidents also lead to reduced healthcare costs and less downtime due to injuries, lowering the economic burden on both companies and workers (who already have limited funds to spend on healthcare).

Given the small number of labour inspectors for the millions of workers in Pakistan, automating safety monitoring safety monitoring ensures better compliance with safety regulations,
reducing the need for a large fleet of human inspectors which suits the current socio-economic conditions of Pakistan's government. 
The proposed system will also provide insights and analytics, which could help Dawlence identify trends and continuously improve workplace safety. This approach encourages a shift towards more proactive safety management, benefiting both employees and employers.
